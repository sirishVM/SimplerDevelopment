// Public Privacy Policy. This is a thorough starting draft tailored to the
// platform's actual data flows — have counsel review and fill the bracketed
// business specifics (legal entity, jurisdiction, mailing address) before
// relying on it. Referenced by the OAuth discovery metadata (op_policy_uri).
//
// Retro-skinned per components/retro/ — but the shared `LegalLayout` /
// `LegalSection` chrome (components/legal/LegalLayout.tsx) styles with the
// default theme's tokens (text-muted-foreground etc.), not the retro ones,
// and it's also used by /terms. Rather than fork that shared file for one
// palette, this page stops importing it and defines its own retro-styled
// `LegalSection` locally — every section body below is untouched, only the
// chrome around it changed. See terms/page.tsx for the identical pattern.

            This Privacy Policy explains how Hatrio (“we,” “us,” “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards information when you use our platform, websites, APIs, and connectors (the “Service”).

            <LegalSection heading="1. Who This Policy Covers">
              <p>
                Hatrio provides a multi-tenant platform for businesses and their clients,
                including a client portal, hosted websites, a CRM, an AI-powered “Company Brain,”
                marketing and automation tools, and integrations with third-party services. This policy
                applies to people who create an account, visitors to pages we host, and end users whose
                information is processed through a customer’s workspace.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where we process information on behalf of a customer (for example, contacts in their CRM
                or content in their workspace), that customer is the controller of the data and we act as
                a processor under their instructions and their own privacy notice.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Account information</strong> — name, email address, password (stored hashed),
                  organization, and role.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Customer content</strong> — data you create or upload, such as CRM records,
                  website content, documents, notes, surveys, media, and the knowledge stored in the
                  Company Brain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Billing information</strong> — subscription plan and transaction metadata.
                  Payment card details are handled by our payment processor and are not stored on our
                  servers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Integration data</strong> — information you authorize us to access from
                  connected third-party services (for example, Google Workspace).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Usage and device data</strong> — log data, IP address, browser/device type,
                  and actions taken in the Service, used for security, debugging, and product
                  improvement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cookies</strong> — used for authentication, session management, and preferences.

            <LegalSection heading="3. How We Use Information">
              <ul>
                <li>To provide, maintain, secure, and improve the Service.</li>
                <li>To authenticate users and protect against fraud and abuse.</li>
                <li>To process subscriptions and billing.</li>
                <li>To power features you use, including AI features that operate on your content.</li>
                <li>To communicate with you about your account, support requests, and material changes.</li>
                <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our agreements.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We do not sell personal information.</p>
            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection heading="4. AI Features (Company Brain)">
              <p>
                The Service includes AI features that process your content to generate answers,
                summaries, classifications, embeddings, and similar output. This processing is scoped to
                your workspace and is not used to train third-party foundation models. AI output may be
                inaccurate or incomplete and should be reviewed before you rely on it. To deliver these
                features we send the relevant content to AI model providers acting as our sub-processors
                (see Section&nbsp;5).
              </p>
            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection heading="5. Third-Party Services and Sub-Processors">
              <p>We rely on trusted third parties to operate the Service. These currently include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Payment processing</strong> — Stripe.</li>
                <li><strong>AI model providers</strong> — including Anthropic, to power AI features.</li>
                <li><strong>Productivity integrations</strong> — Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Drive), when you connect them.</li>
                <li><strong>Hosting and infrastructure</strong> — our cloud hosting and database providers.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each sub-processor receives only the information needed to perform its function and is
                bound by contractual confidentiality and security obligations.
              </p>
            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection heading="6. Connectors and API Access">
              <p>
                You may connect third-party applications and AI clients to your workspace through our
                API and connectors using OAuth. When you authorize a connection, you grant that
                application access to the specific scopes you approve on the consent screen. Access
                tokens are short-lived and refreshed automatically; we store only a hashed form of each
                token.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are responsible for the applications you connect and the access you grant. You can
                review and revoke connected applications and active tokens at any time from your account
                settings, which immediately ends their access.
              </p>
            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection heading="7. How We Share Information">
              <p>We disclose information only as described here:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>With sub-processors that help us operate the Service (Section&nbsp;5).</li>
                <li>With applications you explicitly connect or authorize (Section&nbsp;6).</li>
                <li>Within your organization’s workspace, according to the roles and permissions you set.</li>
                <li>When required by law, legal process, or to protect rights, safety, and security.</li>
                <li>In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, subject to this policy.</li>
              </ul>
            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection heading="8. Data Retention">
              <p>
                We retain information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the
                Service, then delete or anonymize it within a reasonable period, except where longer
                retention is required for legal, accounting, security, or dispute-resolution purposes.
                Customers may request deletion of workspace data as described below.
              </p>
            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection heading="9. Security">
              <p>
                We use administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect
                information, including encryption in transit, hashing of credentials and tokens, tenant
                isolation, scoped access controls, and access logging. No method of transmission or
                storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
              </p>
            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection heading="10. Your Rights and Choices">
              <p>
                Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, export, or delete
                your personal information, and to object to or restrict certain processing. You can
                exercise many of these directly in the Service, or contact us at the address below. If
                your information is processed on behalf of a customer, please direct your request to that
                customer; we will support them in responding.
              </p>
            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection heading="11. International Transfers">
              <p>
                We may process and store information in countries other than where you live. Where
                required, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal
                information.
              </p>
            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection heading="12. Children’s Privacy">
              <p>
                The Service is not directed to children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect
                personal information from them. If you believe a child has provided us information,
                contact us and we will delete it.
              </p>
            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection heading="13. Changes to This Policy">
              <p>
                We may update this policy from time to time. We will revise the “Last updated” date above
                and, for material changes, provide additional notice. Your continued use of the Service
                after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.
