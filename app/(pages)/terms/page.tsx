// Public Terms of Service. Thorough starting draft tailored to the platform —
// have counsel review and fill the bracketed business specifics (legal entity,
// governing-law jurisdiction, mailing address) before relying on it.
// Referenced by the OAuth discovery metadata (op_tos_uri).
//
// Retro-skinned per components/retro/ — same pattern as privacy/page.tsx: the
// shared `LegalLayout` / `LegalSection` chrome (components/legal/LegalLayout.tsx)
// styles with the default theme's tokens, not the retro ones, so this page
// defines its own retro-styled `LegalSection` locally instead of forking that
// shared file. Every section body below is untouched, only the chrome changed.
