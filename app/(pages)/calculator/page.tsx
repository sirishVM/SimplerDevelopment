// The comparison names competitors and quotes their list prices — a deliberate
// departure from /compare, which argues against the generic pattern and names
// nobody. A cost figure without a vendor behind it is a number we invented, so
// this page cites every row (see ./competitor-stack.ts for the sourcing rules).
// It is also deliberately conservative in our own disfavour; the methodology
// band below states exactly how, because a savings calculator that hides its
// assumptions is an advertisement, not a calculator.

// Counted, never typed. The footnote under the sources table and this FAQ
// answer have to agree, and the only way to guarantee that is to derive both
// from the same array — a page arguing that its numbers are checkable cannot
// afford a hardcoded count that quietly goes stale.

PRESS_SOURCED.length} of them (${PRESS_SOURCED.map((c) => c.vendor).join(', ')}) block automated reads of their pricing pages; those figures come from published 2026 pricing write-ups and are marked with a dagger. Nothing here is estimated by us.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this comparing like for like?',
    answer:
      'Capability for capability, yes — a booking module against a booking product, a CRM against a CRM. Feature-for-feature, no, and in both directions: some point tools go deeper in their one niche than our module does, and several of our modules do things their counterpart does not. The calculator compares what a line item costs, not who wins a feature checklist.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why does the gap grow so fast when I add people?',
    answer:
      'Because almost every point tool is priced per seat, and several enforce a seat minimum you pay whether you use it or not — HubSpot Sales Hub Professional bills a minimum of five. Our seats are capped at $30 each regardless of how many modules you run, so team size moves one side of the comparison much harder than the other.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is not in these numbers?',
    answer:
      'Usage overages, payment-processing and transaction fees, AI credit top-ups, and one-time onboarding fees are excluded from both sides. Those exclusions cut against us — HubSpot alone adds a one-time $1,500 onboarding fee we do not count, and Shopify Basic takes 2% of every transaction on top of its monthly price.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I run only some of the modules?',
    answer:
      'Yes — that is the point of ticking boxes. Modules are à-la-carte, and the volume discount only applies once you are running four or more. If you genuinely need one capability and nothing else, a single point tool may well be cheaper, and the calculator will show you that.',

            It is wrong when you only need one thing. A solo operator who wants a scheduling link
            and nothing else should buy a scheduling product — tick one box above and the
            calculator will tell you so itself. It is wrong when a point tool’s depth in its own
            niche is the whole reason you bought it; we are not going to out-feature DocuSign on
            e-signature workflows or Shopify on international tax. And it flatters us on team
            size, because the seat cap is genuinely the strongest thing about our pricing and this
            page lets it do a lot of the work.

            The CRM row is the one to argue with hardest. We compare against HubSpot Sales Hub
            Professional because that is the tier with lead scoring and custom pipelines — the
            things our CRM module actually does — and Professional carries a five-seat minimum. A
            two-person shop that only needs contacts and a simple pipeline could sit on a cheaper
            HubSpot tier and pay far less than this page shows. If that is you, the comparison
            above is not the one to make.

            What it is right about is the shape of the bill. Once you are running four or five of
            these products and paying per seat on each, you are buying the same login, the same
            contact record, and the same integration plumbing several times over. That is the
            money this page is counting.
