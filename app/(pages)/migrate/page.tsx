 * /migrate — the hub above the templated per-product pages.
 *
 * Its job is threefold: rank for the generic "migrate to" intent, carry the
 * parts of the offer that are the same whatever you are coming from (the
 * process, the ownership promise, the guarantee that we will talk you out of
 * it), and hand crawl paths down to every /migrate/<slug> child.
 *
 * Product-specific claims belong in lib/data/migrations.ts, never here — this
 * page must stay true for all eleven sources at once, which is exactly why it
 * cannot carry the detail that makes each child page rank.

            Most migrations just move you from one subscription to another, and the meter starts
            again on the far side. This one doesn’t have to. Hatrio is Apache-2.0 and

            hand over the credentials, and step back. From then on you pay your infrastructure
            provider — not a per-seat licence to us, and not a bill that grows every time your list
            or your team does.
