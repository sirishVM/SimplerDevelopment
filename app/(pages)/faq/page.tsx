// answer is unchanged from the pre-retro copy — the retro voice lives in the
// page chrome (header, band rhythm), not in facts like the licence or crypto.

        question: 'What is Hatrio?',
        answer:
          'An open-source, multi-tenant platform that replaces a stack of separate SaaS tools with one connected system: per-tenant client websites and a block-based CMS, a CRM, an AI "Company Brain" (retrieval-augmented knowledge base), automations, bookings, a storefront, email campaigns, surveys, e-signatures, and Stripe billing — all driveable by an AI agent through a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Who is it for?',
        answer:
          'Agencies and operators who run multiple clients or brands and are tired of stitching together a website builder, a CRM, an email tool, a booking app, and a knowledge base that don\'t share data. Developers also use it as an MCP-native, self-hostable platform to build on.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What makes it different from other all-in-one tools?',
        answer:
          'It is MCP-native, not MCP-bolted-on: 200+ scoped tools span the whole platform, so Claude, Cursor, or any MCP client can build a page, manage the CRM, or send a campaign by talking to an agent. It is also fully open source (Apache-2.0) and self-hostable, so there is no lock-in.',

    category: 'Pricing & plans',
    items: [
      {
        question: 'How much does it cost?',
        answer:
          'Self-hosting is free forever — bring your own infrastructure and API keys, no seat caps, no feature gates. Managed hosting, run by the team that builds the platform, is also available — contact us for a quote.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you offer agency or white-label plans?',
        answer:
          'Yes — white-label portals (custom portal domain, your branding), multi-seat agency accounts, and reseller arrangements are all available. Contact us and we will put together a custom quote.',

    category: 'Open source & self-hosting',

      },
      {
        question: 'What do I need to self-host?',
        answer:
          'A PostgreSQL database with the pgvector extension (for the Company Brain), Bun, and a handful of environment secrets. A Docker Compose file provisions Postgres + pgvector locally, and the quick start gets you from clone to running. Deploy on Vercel, Railway, or any Next.js host with your own Postgres.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the difference between self-hosted and hosted?',
        answer:
          'The codebase is identical. Self-host it free and bring your own Postgres and API keys, or have the team that builds it run managed hosting for you (contact us for a quote). There is no feature difference forced by hosting.',

      {

          'Through the MCP server it can operate the platform: create and edit pages and posts, manage CRM contacts/deals, draft and send email campaigns, query the Company Brain, manage projects and bookings, and more — each tool gated by a permission scope. Write actions that affect live content go through an approval step a human confirms.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Which AI clients can connect?',
        answer:
          'Any Model Context Protocol client — Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Claude.ai (via OAuth), and Cursor — plus ChatGPT where MCP connectors are available. Connect with a portal API key or the OAuth 2.1 flow.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I use my own AI key (BYOK)?',
        answer:
          'Yes. Bring your own OpenAI or Anthropic key and run the AI at cost with no platform markup. Keys are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM).',

      {

      },
      {
        question: 'Is it secure and multi-tenant safe?',
        answer:
          'Every record is keyed by tenant (clientId / siteId) and access is enforced at the data layer and on every MCP tool via scope guards. There is two-factor authentication (TOTP), bcrypt password hashing, OAuth 2.1 with PKCE for API clients, and a tenancy regression test suite that runs on every data-access change.',
