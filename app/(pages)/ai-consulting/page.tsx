/**
 * /ai-consulting — the agency services page (PUX-091).
 *
 * This page sells a DIFFERENT thing than the rest of the marketing tree. Every
 * other public page sells the platform (open source, self-hostable, MCP-native);
 * this one sells implementation work, and the platform appears as evidence and
 * as an optional substrate, never as the deliverable. That seam is deliberate
 * and load-bearing: there is exactly ONE primary CTA on the page (get a quote)
 * and the platform is always the secondary path. If you add a second competing
 * "start free" CTA above the fold, the page stops converting for either
 * audience — that was the explicit trade-off accepted when it shipped.
 *
 * The page publishes NO prices. Engagements are quoted per scope, so the offer
 * band advertises the shape and duration of the work and the quote form carries
 * the conversion. That is a deliberate reversal of the launch version, which
 * carried "from $X" anchors; re-adding them is a positioning decision, not a
 * copy tweak. The one cost figure still mentioned (in the Flight Plan step) is
 * the client's own monthly inference spend, not our fee.
 *
 * Copy is written answer-first under question-shaped headings, and the FAQ is
 * fully visible with no accordion, for the same reason app/(pages)/faq/page.tsx
 * is: answer engines extract prose they can read without executing JS, and the
 * visible text must match generateFAQSchema below verbatim.
 *
 * Every number on this page is verifiable in-repo — 478 is the canonical tool
 * count from packages/cli/manifest.json (enforced by
 * tests/unit/mcp-tool-registry-baseline.test.ts) and 51 is BUILT_IN_BLOCK_TYPES
 * in lib/blocks/registry.ts. There are no invented client case studies or
 * testimonials here, because we have none to cite. If you add a stat, add it
 * from the code, and update it when the code moves.

      'We quote each engagement against its own scope rather than publishing a list price, because the honest answer depends on how many systems the agent has to touch, how clean your data is, and whether the result needs approval gates and audit trails. Send us the workflow through the quote form and you will get a fixed scope and a fixed price back, usually within one working day. That price does not move once agreed.',

    question: 'How long until something is actually in production?',
    answer:
      'Two weeks for a single workflow in an Agent Sprint. Six to twelve weeks for a multi-agent build. We deliberately put the first agent in front of real data in week one, because pilots that stay in a sandbox are how most AI projects quietly die.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which framework will you use — Mastra, CrewAI, or LangGraph?',
    answer:
      'Whichever fits your stack and your failure modes, and we write the reasoning down. Mastra when you are TypeScript or Next.js and want typed tools and built-in evals. CrewAI when the work maps to a crew of role-specialists and you want a fast prototype. LangGraph when runs are long, need approval gates, or must survive a crash. MCP sits underneath any of them as the integration layer.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do we own the code?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Code lands in your repository under your licence, with no runtime dependency on us and no per-seat fee to keep using it. Our own platform is Apache-2.0 for the same reason: we do not think lock-in is a business model.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do we have to use the Hatrio platform?',
    answer:
      'No. Most engagements build into the client’s existing stack. The platform is there if you want somewhere to run the result — CRM, documents, automations, and a 478-tool MCP server already wired up — but choosing it is optional and never a condition of the work.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if our data is a mess?',
    answer:
      'That is the normal starting condition, and it is usually the actual project. Retrieval quality is set by how your documents are structured, chunked, and permissioned long before the model matters. We audit that in the flight plan and tell you honestly if the first phase needs to be data work rather than agents.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you stop an agent doing something destructive?',
    answer:
      'Scoped credentials so an agent can only reach what it needs, approval gates on every write path so a human confirms consequential actions, and an eval set that runs on each change so regressions surface before your customers find them. We build the same way on our own platform, where AI-proposed changes go through a human approval queue.',

              of the build wiring up plumbing.
