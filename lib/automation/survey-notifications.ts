/**
 * Survey Response Notifications
 *
 * Listens for `survey.response_submitted` events and sends a notification
 * email to the survey owner (the client's primary portal user) when the
 * survey has `notifyOnResponse = true` and `notifyDigest = 'off'`.
 *
 * Registers its own handler with the event bus — runs in parallel with
 * the user-facing automation rule engine, which processes custom rules.
 *
 * Digest modes (`daily` / `weekly`) mean "do NOT send immediately" — the batched
 * send belongs to app/api/cron/process-survey-digests, which reads straight off
 * `survey_responses.completed_at` against the `surveys.last_digest_sent_at`
 * watermark. So the early return below hands the response to that job; it does
 * not drop it.
 *
 * It used to drop it. Until PUX-084 this handler returned on digest mode without
 * sending AND without queueing, and the queue it pointed at
 * (`survey_notification_queue`) was never built — so choosing a digest silently
 * switched a survey's notifications off entirely. The justification recorded here
 * was "no cron mechanism exists in the current stack", which had gone stale: there
 * are 47 cron routes registered in vercel.json.

/**
 * Resolve which addresses receive notifications for one survey.
 *
 * Recipients are stored as portal user ids (`surveys.notify_user_ids`), never as
 * addresses — see the column comment in lib/db/schema/surveys.ts for why. This is
 * the only place ids become addresses, and it re-joins `client_members` on every
 * send rather than trusting the stored list: an id that was valid when it was
 * saved but whose membership has since been revoked resolves to nothing, so
 * removing someone from the account stops their notifications immediately with no
 * cleanup pass over every survey.
 *
 * The clientId filter is the tenancy boundary, and it is applied HERE as well as
 * at write time deliberately. A stored id belonging to another tenant — from a bad
 * backfill, a restored row, or direct SQL — must not be able to receive another
 * client's survey responses, and enforcing it on the read is what makes that true
 * regardless of how the row came to exist.
 *
 * Falls back to the client owner when the list is empty, which is exactly who every
 * survey notified before this column existed (so the migration needs no backfill).
 * It also falls back when every listed id fails to resolve: a notification reaching
 * the owner unexpectedly is a smaller failure than one silently reaching nobody.
